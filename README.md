Restaurant finder app

You can find the restaurants all around the world with this app. You can also see menu, prices, opening hours, adress and some images from each restaurant. 
You can also add the restaurants to your favourites by clicking the heart shaped button located in upper-right corner of the restaurant. Scroll through many restaurants and pick your favourites.
